## Accessibility Testing Tools

CivicActions recommends two testing tools for accessibility: [axeDevTools](https://deque.com/axe/devtools/) (only available on Chrome) and [Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io/).

## Quick Checklist

This list is not comprehensive, but it is a quick rundown of things to think through when creating markup and styling pages:

### Keyboard Use

It is important that users can logically tab through items on each page and that it is obvious when the keyboard focus is on each element.

### Headings and Semantic Markup

 - Headings must be in order (Only H2s after H1, and only H3 after H2, etc)
 - Use semantic markup instead of divs where possible.
