## Accessibility Testing Tools

CivicActions recommends two testing tools for accessibility: [axeDevTools](https://deque.com/axe/devtools/) (only available on Chrome) and [Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io/).

## Quick Checklist

This list is not comprehensive, but it is a quick rundown of things to think through when creating markup and styling pages:

### Make the keyboard usable

- It is important that users can logically tab through items on each page and that it is obvious when the keyboard focus is on each element
- Pay special attention to modals and other interactive bits. When the modal opens, does keyboard focus come with it? Can you close the modal with a keyboard?
- Make sure form labels describe the function of each form control

### Use Headings as an outline

 - Headings must be in order (Only H2s after H1, and only H3 after H2, etc)
[Headings Detaials](https://webaim.org/techniques/semanticstructure/#headings)

### Wrap with semantic markup

 - Use semantic markup instead of divs where possible. (`<header>, <nav>, <main>, <aside>, and <footer>`)

### Use alt text on images
 - All images need alt text
 - Alt text should be concise and descriptive
 - If an image is decorative, use an empty alt tag (`alt=" "`)

### Tell users if content changes dynamically
 - Use the [Aria Live](https://webaim.org/techniques/aria/#dynamic) property for static or headless implementations without Drupal's formatting.
 - For Drupal sites, use the [Drupal.announce() Function](https://www.drupal.org/node/2014521), which provides support for ARIA Live
