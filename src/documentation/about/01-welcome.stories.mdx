## Setup

This resource library is built using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). All of the content is maintained by the engineers in the front end practice area at CivicActions.

We selected Storybook as the basis for this library in order to enable a more straightforward approach to contributing and documenting shared knowledge and resources.
