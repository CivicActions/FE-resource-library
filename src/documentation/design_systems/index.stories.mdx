# Design Systems & Style Guides

## USWDS
The U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) is a design system for the federal government. Its goal is to make it easier to build accessible, mobile-friendly government websites for the American public.

It has been made a more important tool with the [21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act(IDEA)](https://digital.gov/resources/21st-century-integrated-digital-experience-act/) which states that it should be used for federal government websites.

The Drupal 8 theme for USWDS is maintained be fellow CivicActioners Iris Ibekwe and Jay Darnell.
