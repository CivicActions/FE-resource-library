<Meta title="Hooks/StateWithLocalStorage" component={TestComponent} />

This hook behaves like the default useState hook in React, except state values are also saved to local storage.
This allows state to persist when the page is refreshed.

```js
const [state, setState] = useStateWithLocalStorage(
  "my-local-storage-key",
  "initial state"
);
```

<Story name="StateWithLocalStorage">
  <TestComponent key="my-state-key" initialState="initial state" />
</Story>
