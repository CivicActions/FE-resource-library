# FE-resource-library
## üõ†Ô∏è The CivicActions Front End Resource Library

The primary goal of this repo is to house shared knowledge and resources that support:

1. The setup and expansion of project workflows with best practices in mind
2. Documenting approaches, recipes, and best practices for common issues and requriements
3. The general growth and advancement of the Front End practice area at CivicActions

The secondary goal of this repo is to create an npm package(s) of common components, hooks, baseline styling, and other settings and configurations that will support the setup of various projects.

## Setup
This resource library is built using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). All of the content is maintained by the engineers in the front end practice area at CivicActions.

We selected Storybook as the basis for this library in order to enable a more straightforward approach to contributing and documenting shared knowledge and resources.
## Commands
- `npn install` to install all packages.
- `npm run storybook` will create a Storybook instance at `localhost:6006`.
- `npm test` will run the complete test suite.
- `npm run build` will run Webpack and build the dist file.
